This is a collection of some server administration tools I wrote.

Written in PHP. Reads your Postfix logfile and creates a statistic of TLS usage.

phpLeases
---------

Written in PHP. Reads the ISC-DHCPD leases-file and creates a table of all leases. Reads the ISC-BIND db-dump and creates a table of all cache entries.
